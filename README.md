# HypOps
The intended final product here is a Python module with functions that compute the values of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation">hyperoperations</a> for real and complex values, as well as compute the values of their inverses.

The hyperoperations I have no intent of including are those of order 1, 2, and 3 (addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, respectively). These are already included in Python. 

The 0th hyperoperation, zeration (commonly known as the successor function), is included for now. As a joke more than anything. 

<i>(The joke is that zer() and zerLog() perform trivial functions while zerRoot() performs no useful function at all.)

(But zer() is the basis of our entire arithmetic system so...)</i>

The hyperoperation currently in queue for being added is the 4h hyperoperation, tetration. A lot of research and analysis still has to be done to make the output of tet(), tetLog(), and tetRoot() well-defined enough to actually be calculable, but hopefully the project will be there sooner rather than later. 

If you have any questions, please shoot me a message! My research on hyperoperations is currently my favorite project and I love to talk about it.
